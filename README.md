## Brief Description:
Toronto is home to many amazing local cafes with many dedicated Canadian speciality coffee roasters. Our team aims to develop a centralized web-app for coffee enthusiasts to discover and support quality cafes across the city and roasters across Canada. Users will be able to read/write reviews about cafes (highlighting the nuances in their coffee), make coffee bean purchases and subscribe to monthly coffee bag purchases from their favourite roasters. Cafes/roasters will be able to post their menu, advertise the avaliability of their coffee beans and give users suggestions for how to best prepare their coffee to bring out the key tasting notes and varietal characteristics. 

### Modern Framework of Choice:
Angular

### Additional Requirement of Choice:
Real-time updates: User reviews and ratings will update continuously. Cafes will be able to update their images, seating avaliability, price adjustments and advertise local events/promotions occuring at the shop.
